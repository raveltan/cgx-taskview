# Intro

Hi and welcome,

in this video i'll show you all features of cgx taskview.

but, what is cgx taskview?

cgx taskview is a javafx based kanban like application that allows you to take note of certain category,

but in this case we are more focused to provide a real-time kanban that with low latency,

this is especially useful for projects which is time critical and team leader want to give live updates.

## Github

now we are here in the github page of cgx taskview, to use it we can go to release page and download the version for our device.

in this case i've downloaded the files.

## Javafx

this is the main application, the first time we open the app, we'll be greeted with this login screen.

we can of course login to enjoy the functionalities.

**Error Checking**

this app also provides auth related form validation,

### Dashboard

This is the dashboard of cgx taskview, here we can see all created project.

we can create one here.

we are also going to open the public page with this button.

then we can go inside of the task

### Task

we can see that we have 3 type of tasks here, planned,done and progress.

we can of course add task(s) to these types.

and if we show our web page and the mobile app, then add a new task

we can see that the update is instanenous and the latency is small.

and if we delete a task the update is instant too,

we can also directly delete the whole project if we want.

### Token

we will go back to dashboard after deleting a project,

if we close the app in a loged in state when we get back to the app, we'll be automatically logged in,

## End

So that's it
